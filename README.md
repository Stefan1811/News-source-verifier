# News-source-verifier

## Project Description: 

In the world we live in, any news we read can be fake news. Whether we are talking about politics, war, or even everyday news, the press, and social networks are looking for views, the number of clicks, and the sensational. Also, some messages are/can be intentionally directed to a certain area precisely to mislead readers. (https://www.biziday.ro/analiza-the-telegraph-miniciunile-de-pe-85732344231/) 
The purpose of this system is to receive news in the form of a link and to answer with a list of similar, reliable sources and a “Trust-score” to verify the authenticity of the news. We can also look at Twitter's Community Notes if they exist for that news as well. The project can be done using ML/AI or even traditional scrapping.
